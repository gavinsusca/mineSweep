# mineSweep

This is just the simple game of MineSweeper I used to love as a kid. 
I have a Gui version is the works as well. 

For anyone who doesn't know how to play. 

x x x x 
x x 2 x 
x x x x 

The "2" above means any two of the surrounding "x" will be a bomb. 
Meaning six spaces are not bombs. 
Mark all the spots you think are bombs correct and guess all the spots which aren't bombs 
and you win.
